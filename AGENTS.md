Project goal: BigQuery-based call-center scheduler.
Conventions:
  - Use migration-style SQL under sql/migrations (001..008).
  - Keep data/ for seed CSVs; docs/ for architecture notes.
Tasks Codex should run:
  - Create folders and starter files exactly as listed below.
  - Validate paths; if files exist, update rather than overwrite.
  - Open a PR with a summary of created files.
